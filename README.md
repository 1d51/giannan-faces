# giannan-faces
A state based dynamic dialog replacer for the game Odyssey of Gianna. It uses the StateText plugin to read a configuration file (`statetext.json`) and makes changes on the fly based on its contents. It's designed to be used with the [MV Mod Loader](https://github.com/1d51/mv-mod-loader). To install, simply drop the files in this repo into a folder within `mods`.
